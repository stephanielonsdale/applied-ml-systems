# Address Classification

End-to-end machine learning pipeline for classifying noisy address strings into predefined categories, compared against a regex-based baseline.

## Notebook
- `notebooks/address_classification.ipynb`

## What this demonstrates
- Regex baseline vs supervised ML comparison
- Feature engineering with CountVectorizer
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- Error analysis and improvement considerations

## Data note
Raw datasets are not included in this repository.
